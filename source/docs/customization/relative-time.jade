p
  code moment.relativeTime
  |  should be an object of the replacement strings for 
  code moment.fn.from
  | .
pre moment.relativeTime = {\n
  |     future: "in %s",
  |     past: "%s ago",
  |     s: "seconds",
  |     m: "a minute",
  |     mm: "%d minutes",
  |     h: "an hour",
  |     hh: "%d hours",
  |     d: "a day",
  |     dd: "%d days",
  |     M: "a month",
  |     MM: "%d months",
  |     y: "a year",
  |     yy: "%d years"
  | };
p
  code future
  |  refers to the prefix/suffix for future dates, and 
  code past
  |  refers to the prefix/suffix for past dates. For all others, a single character refers to the singular, and an double character refers to the plural.
p If a language requires additional processing for a token, It can set the token as a function with the following signature. 
  | The function should return a string.
pre function(number, withoutSuffix, key) {\n
  |     return string;
  | }
p The 
  code key
  |  variable refers to the replacement key in the 
  code relativeTime 
  |  object. (eg. 's', 'm', 'mm', 'h', etc.)
p The 
  code number
  |  variable refers to the number of units for that key. For 'm', the number is the number of minutes, etc.
p The 
  code withoutSuffix
  |  variable will be true if the token will be displayed without a suffix, and false if it will be displayed with a suffix. 
  | (The reason for the inverted logic is because the default behavior is to display with the suffix.)
