p Sometimes, you want all the goodness of 
  code moment.fn.from
  |  but you don't want to have to create two moments, you just want to display a length of time.
p Enter 
  code moment.humanizeDuration
  | . With only a number passed in, it will return the humanized duration of the number as milliseconds.
pre
  | moment.humanizeDuration(1000 * 60); // a minute
p To use a different time difference, pass it in as a string.
pre
  | moment.humanizeDuration(1, "seconds"); // a few seconds
  | moment.humanizeDuration(1, "minutes"); // a minute
  | moment.humanizeDuration(1, "hours");   // an hour
  | moment.humanizeDuration(1, "days");    // a day
  | moment.humanizeDuration(1, "weeks");   // 7 days
  | moment.humanizeDuration(1, "months");  // a month
  | moment.humanizeDuration(1, "years");   // a year
p By default, the return string is suffixless. If you want a suffix, pass in true as seen below.
pre
  | moment.humanizeDuration(60000, true);        // in a minute
  | moment.humanizeDuration(1, "minutes", true); // in a minute
p For suffixes before now, pass in a negative number.
pre
  | moment.humanizeDuration(-60000, true);        // a minute ago
  | moment.humanizeDuration(-1, "minutes", true); // a minute ago
