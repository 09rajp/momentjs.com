title: Where to use it
---


In order to use moment-timezone, you will need `moment@2.6.0` or greater, the core `moment-timezone` library, and the `moment-timezone` data.

You can use the data builder at [momentjs.com/timezone/data/](/timezone/data/) to construct a data set with only the zones needed.
